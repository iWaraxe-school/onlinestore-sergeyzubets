## Task #5
Read all materials, try to find a `proper` place to your newly learned patterns in our app. There are a lot of design patterns, but we advise you to pay attention to the following ones:
- Singleton;
- ChainOfResponsibility;
- Fabric.
The application of patterns consists not only in their implementation, but also in knowing their weaknesses and strengths. Therefore, in addition to realising the selected design patterns in the code, you must write the following justification for each pattern (you can send it to me in the messenger, or you can add text to README.md): 
- What is the Design Pattern? 
- Where did you apply it? 
- Justify why you chose this one and not another. What do you gain by using chosen Design Pattern?
## Hints
Rethink your application from SOLID point of view. Keep in mind that in addition to implementing multithreading, we will also work with the database and http. In many ways, we will repeat what we did for the console application for both the database and the http layers. It might be worth coming up with some common interfaces that different versions will implement.
